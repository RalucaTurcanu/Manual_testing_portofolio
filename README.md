# Manual_testing_portofolio
&nbsp;
## Introduction

The purpose for this Portofolio is to summerise the acquired information from the Manual Testing course and how I applied them in practice, using different methods and applications.

The main testing activity was done on the [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) application, for the Admin modul. The requirements of the Admin modul can be found [here](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf.), from which I chose the "User Management" and "Job" sub-menus.
For bug tracking and project managing I have used Jira Software with the Zephyr Squad tool.

For REST API testing of [Simple Book](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md) I have used Postman tool.

For creating, designing and building databases I have used MySQL Workbench tool.

Next, I will detail the process and results of the testing technics applied in 2 sections: [Testing Section](#testing-section) and [SQL Section](#sql-section).
